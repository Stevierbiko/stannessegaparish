            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>
              St. Anneâ€™s Sega Catholic Parish was established in 1931 at Sihay
              centre by Mill Hill Missionaries led by Fr. Vergman to reduce
              distance travelled by faithfuls to Rangala Parish. In addition to
              establishing the church, the missionaries also established a
              school to introduce formal education to the local faithfuls.
            </p>
            <p>
              Due to unfavourable weather conditions in Sihay. In 1922, the
              church moved to its present location at Sega Centre in North
              Ugenya Ward, Ugenya Sub County of Siaya County. Since
              establishment, Ukwala, Yogo and Mban Parishes that were initially
              sub parishes of Sega are now stand alone parishes. Currently, the
              Parish has an estimated population of 4,000 Christians served by 9
              Sub Parishes with 88 Small Christian Communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              To ensure wholesome spiritual and social development the church
              also established a mission complex with 2 secondary schools and 2
              primary schools a hospital and a vocational training Centre.
              Moreover, the church also sponsors 18 more primary schools and 2
              secondary schools within its jurisdiction. From inception to date,
              the Parish has been served by 25 Priests 11 catechists and
              mentored 15 Priests and 10 Sisters who are now serving in various
              parishes and institutions.
